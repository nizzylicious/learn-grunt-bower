# Learn Grunt and Bower

Workshop to learn Grunt and Bower with hands-on exercises.


## Install tools

On Windows you need Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads

You also need Node.js and npm which are both installed from: https://nodejs.org/

## Open Git Bash

We are going to run all our commands in Git Bash.

## Install Grunt

If you haven't already installed Grunt, run

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Fork this repository on Github

If you don't have a Github account, you can make one at: https://github.com/join

With your account, you can then browse to https://github.com/ebabel-eu/learn-grunt-bower and fork the repository (top right button).

Your code will be checked in to your own repository for later reference.

## Clone your repository on your computer

In Git Bash, or any other tool where you normally manage Git, clone your own repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/[your username]/learn-grunt-bower.git
```

You can then switch to that directory to run your commands:

```
cd learn-grunt-bower
```

## Grunt scaffolding

It's possibly to copy paste your Grunt from an existing project, but we're going to look into grunt-init scaffolding.

```
npm install -g grunt-init
```

On Windows, your grunt init scaffolding templates are to be installed in %USERPROFILE%\.grunt-init\
